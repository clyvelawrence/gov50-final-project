## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to mobility justice or transit. It would be interesting to do a project about access to public transportation like trains and buses. For example, how does access to transit differ in regions across the world? How far does the average person have to travel to access their transit services?

There is UN sustainability data about transportation accessibility that I might look at (some of which I already downloaded to install here later, maybe).

I could also do something based on bike lanes, with variables like distance traveled, race, city, etc.

The idea would be to show that mobility access is an important factor when designing a city and that we should think about repairing communities and our built environment by creating sustainable, multimodal options.
